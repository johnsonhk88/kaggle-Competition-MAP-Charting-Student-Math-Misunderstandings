# Dataset Description

On Eedi, students answer Diagnostic Questions (DQs), which are multiple-choice questions featuring one correct answer and three incorrect answers, known as distractors. After responding with a multiple-choice selection, students were sometimes asked to provide a written explanation justifying their selected answer. These explanations are the primary focus of the MAP dataset and are to be used to identify and address potential misconceptions in studentsâ€™ reasoning.

The goal of the competition is to develop a model that performs 3 steps:

Determines whether the selected answer is correct. (True or False in Category; e.g., True_Correct)
Assesses whether the explanation contains a misconception. (Correct, Misconception, or Neither in Category; e.g., True_Correct)
Identifies the specific misconception present, if any.
The Diagnostic Questions were presented in image format on the Eedi platform. All question content, including mathematical expressions, has been extracted via a human-in-the-loop OCR process to ensure accuracy.

QuestionId - Unique question identifier.
QuestionText - The text of the question.
MC_Answer - The multiple-choice answer the student selected.
StudentExplanation - A student's explanation for choosing a specific multiple-choice answer.
Category - [train only] A classification of the relationship between a student's multiple-choice answer and their explanation (e.g., True_Misconception, which indicates a correct multiple-choice answer selection accompanied by an explanation that reveals a misconception).
Misconception - [train only] The math misconception identified in the student's explanation for answers. Only applicable when Category contains a misconception, otherwise is 'NA'.
sample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.

Category:Misconception - The predicted classification Category concatenated with the Misconception by a colon (:). Up to three predictions can be made, separated by a space.
The re-run test data contains approximately 16,000 rows.
